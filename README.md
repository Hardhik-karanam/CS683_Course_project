Made Changes in virtuoso_utopia.config file, unable to upload all the files in githu
## Getting Started

Virtuoso is built on top of Sniper but can be plugged into multiple simulators.  
We refer the users to Sniper's [website](https://snipersim.org/w/Getting_Started) and manual for more information about the underlying simulator.
